# Hey, I'm Murillo ðŸ‘‹

**Data Engineering Lead @ Branching Minds** and **Founder of [Datoga.io](https://datoga.io)**.  
I design and lead modern data platforms with **Databricks, Spark, dbt, Dagster, Airbyte**â€”turning messy data into reliable, governed, and cost-efficient pipelines.

## Now
- Leading a Data Engineering team building a new data architecture (files from multiple US school districts â†’ reliable datasets powering apps and analytics).
- Running Datoga.io, a consultancy focused on **Modern Data Stack, Data Quality/Governance, and AI-assisted automation**.

## What Iâ€™m good at
- **Modern Data Platforms**: lakehouse design, ingestion â†’ bronze/silver/gold, SCD/Snapshots, cost/perf tuning.
- **Data Quality & Governance**: contracts, tests, lineage, SLAs, access with Unity Catalog.
- **Orchestration & Ops**: Dagster jobs, event-driven pipelines, CI/CD for data, observability and alerts.
- **Enablement**: standards, templates, and docs that help teams ship faster with fewer regressions.

## Selected outcomes
- Standardized ingestion across vendors and districts, reducing ad-hoc work and incidents.
- Introduced snapshot/SCD patterns to cut unnecessary reprocessing and improve downstream reliability.
- Evolved data quality checks and metadata to support governance and safer product releases.
- Drove a practical migration path toward a scalable lakehouse with clear ownership.

## Core stack
**Databricks â€¢ Spark â€¢ dbt â€¢ Dagster â€¢ Airbyte â€¢ SQL â€¢ Python â€¢ Delta Lake â€¢ AWS (S3, Glue, Lambda, Athena)**  
Also used: Metabase, GitHub Actions, Terraform, APIs, Crawlers, GCP (BigQuery/PubSub) when needed.

## Availability
Iâ€™m **not actively job-seeking**, but Iâ€™m **open to selective conversations** for **Senior/Staff/Lead** roles or **short-term advisory/consulting** that align with building resilient data platforms at scale.
